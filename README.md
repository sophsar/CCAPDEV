to fix for MCO2

(1) storing and using images
    - when signing up, every pixel of the image should be converted to binary (?)
    or
    - use libraries

(2) add 'edit owner profile' feature (?)
(3) error on owner replies, replyText can't be stored in the db

(4) helpful / unhelpful buttons (not sure if needed for MCO2 or for MCO3)
    - should show number of clicks
    - if user has already clicked on the button, it has to stay active, unless unclicked.

for MCO3

(1) CRUD operations
    - update (edit)
        - profile
        - review 
    - delete
        - profile
        - review

(2) sessions
    - login stuff if there's anything wrong w the implementation (?)
(3) cookies
    - remember me (on login)
