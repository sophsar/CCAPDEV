to fix for MCO2

(1) storing and using images
    - when signing up, every pixel of the image should be converted to binary (?)
    or
    - use libraries

(2) helpful / unhelpful buttons (not sure if needed for MCO2 or for MCO3)
    - should show number of clicks
    - if user has already clicked on the button, it has to stay active, unless unclicked.
